# Nightwatch.js
This is my short demonstration of Nightwatch.js performing automated UI tests on a Website https://katalon-demo-cura.herokuapp.com/ that is developed by Katalon Studio for testing purposes. 
To run the demo, create a blank folder, and clone the repo.  
Then inside the workspace folder, in the terminal, run the command: **npm install**  
To run the test, run the command: **npm run test**
